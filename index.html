              <p>
                Bullying at schools is not a new phenomenon and happens
                everywhere in the world. There are number of known reasons that
                children get bullied at schools. It might be because of their
                physical, personality, gender differences; or just being in the
                wrong place in the wrong time.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this project we use <strong> VCAMS </strong> children who are
                bullied dataset provided by department of education and
                training. It is compulsory for all students across Victoria to
                take the student Attitude to school (AtoS) survey at end of each
                term. In this survey there is a question about whether a student
                has been bullied in this term and those answers have been
                anonymised and collected. The data has been presented with the
                granularity of local area government (LGA) in Victoria which we
                refer to council from now on to avoid confusion.

                Bullying rate that has been used extensively throughout this
                project which is the ratio of people who answered positive for
                getting bullied in the survey over the total of participation of
                the survey. The Data collection started at 2006 and extends
                until 2018. Collectively <mark>2,322,661</mark> people have took
                the survey over the past 13 years and <mark>462,570</mark> of
                them have reported of getting bullied at schools.
